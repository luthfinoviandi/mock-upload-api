This a mock file server for testing uploading and retrieving files.

Files are stored in the memory of the server for a short time and are then removed.

```shell
npm install mock-file-server
```

You can then run the server as follows:

```shell
node node_modules/mock-file-server/server.js
```

You can also run it as a `grunt task`.
